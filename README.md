# Getting Started with Social Support Webapp

The Social Support Application is a bilingual (English/Arabic) web form that helps citizens apply for financial aid through a 3-step process. It collects personal, financial, and situational information in a user-friendly, mobile-responsive interface. In the final step, users can use integrated AI (via Open source API) to generate assistance text for describing their financial circumstances. The app supports RTL layout, accessibility standards, and local storage to save progress
